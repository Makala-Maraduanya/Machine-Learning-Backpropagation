# Machine-Learning-Backpropagation
This is machine learning model demonstrating backpropagation implemented using octave

This is a machine learning model using backpropagation to learn the parameters that can be used to predict the type of wheat seed it is using some features of the seed.
This task has been accomplished using python on the following site: https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/
This implementation is in Octave the language used by Andrew Ng in his Coursera ML classes.

I am open to constructive criticism on the work.
